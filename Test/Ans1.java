Compile time:when a source code is converted into byte or class by using default command as javac at console.
Eg: class Anime
	{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
	System.out.println("series");
	}
	}
At console javac Anime.java

Runtime :where jvm converts the byte code into sequence of binary code machine understandable language.(0's and 1's)
 
java Anime
